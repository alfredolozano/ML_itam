This is a very usefull and complete set of examples on how to use and how to implement some of the most famous techniques in machine learning.

All af this are a set of jupyter notebooks assigned as homework for ITAM's Masters in Data Science course on Machine Learning.

Most of the code is not mine, it comes directly from the pandas, numpy or sklearn documentation.
